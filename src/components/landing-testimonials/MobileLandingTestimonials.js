Dedicated to understanding the role and identifying the right candidates that will be successful, Kyle is a partner to both hiring manager and candidates. He moves fast too, great for both of us, working hard to make the right match! I was able to partner with Nine to Five and they were able to significantly increased the caliber of Marketing interns during my search. I recommend everyone to reach out to Kyle and Nine to Five to find more targeted, quality interns and recent graduates!"
              : "I can strongly stand behind this recommendation, as I was able to utilize Nine to Five to get into the Predictive Analytics Masterâ€™s Program at Northwestern. It was through this process I was able to grasp that not only was Kyle a skilled professional, but that he cared about the advancement of the people we worked with. Additionally, as he worked with me to refresh my resume and prepare for interviews, I recognized that his exceptional eye for detail would be an incredible asset for anyone looking to advance their career."

Nine to Five has an excellent future ahead of them."

Kyle is genuinely interested in helping each and every person that comes to him.  He took the time to understand all the factors that I am considering when looking for a career.  He's professional, organized, easy to talk to, and is willing to help throughout the entire process.  Never once did I feel discouraged because Kyle was always there to give me the advice I needed to succeed!"

Kyle was great to work with, my mom even ended up using him as she was looking to get back into the workplace.

Loved doing business with them and cannot say enough positive things!"
