        name="Christine B."
        testimonial="I can strongly stand behind this recommendation, as I was able to utilize Nine to Five to get into the
Predictive Analytics Masterâ€™s Program at Northwestern. It was through this process I was able to grasp
that not only was Kyle a skilled professional, but that he cared about the advancement of the people we
worked with. Additionally, as he worked with me to refresh my resume and prepare for interviews, I
recognized that his exceptional eye for detail would be an incredible asset for anyone looking to
advance their career."

He's professional, organized, easy to talk to, and is willing to help throughout the entire process.

        testimonial="I absolutely loved working with Nine to Five and everything they have done for my career! I have gotten SO many compliments on my resume. Kyle was great to work with, my mom even ended up using him as she was looking to get back into the workplace. Working with a professional like Kyle was such a great experience as I did not learn these valuable interview and job searching skills while in college. Loved doing business with them and cannot say enough positive things!"
