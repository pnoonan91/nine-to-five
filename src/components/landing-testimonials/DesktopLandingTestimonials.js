        testimonial="I can strongly stand behind this recommendation, as I was able to utilize Nine to Five to get into the
Predictive Analytics Masterâ€™s Program at Northwestern. It was through this process I was able to grasp
that not only was Kyle a skilled professional, but that he cared about the advancement of the people we
worked with. Additionally, as he worked with me to refresh my resume and prepare for interviews, I
recognized that his exceptional eye for detail would be an incredible asset for anyone looking to
advance their career."
